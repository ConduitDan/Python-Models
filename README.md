Some cute physics models in python

This is where I maintian some basic physics models in python.
Current models include:
  Vicsek model of flocking
  Ising model of magnetism
  Kuromoto model of synchronization
 
Additionaly there is an animator class that can take a 2d array of models and animate them all on a single figure and save it to a gif
Examples of how to use each model are the the bottom of the approiate module
